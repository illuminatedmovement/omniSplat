omniSplat is a unified ecosystem that enables high-precision spatial capture, processing, and visualization while enabling users to retain data sovereignty and provenance. The system consists of five main components:

1. Mobile dApp: A Solana Mobile Native application for capturing spatial data with RTK precision

2. Processing Pipeline: A desktop/decentralized cloud processing system that converts captured data into 3D/4D models using dual splatting modes

3. Blockchain Layer: A Solana smart contract system that ensures spatial data provenance and authenticity 

4. 3D/4D Viewer: A web-based visualization and export system for interacting with processed models

5. 3D Software Ecosystem Integrations: Smooth transfers into popular 3D workflows such as Unreal, 3DS Max, Cinema4D, etc.
